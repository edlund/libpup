# libPowerUP - Create games with SDL2 and OpenGL

Origin: https://bitbucket.org/erikedlund/libpup

Mirror: https://github.com/edlund/libpup

This is a work in progress, relatively untested and might be abandoned
in the near future. Use at your own risk.

The following libraries are required when building a project with pup:

 * GL
 * GLU
 * Glew
 * SDL2
 * SDL2_mixer
 * FreeType2
 * boost
 * catch
 * pthread

Define `CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER` globally for your build in order to avoid
problems with catch implementing main().
